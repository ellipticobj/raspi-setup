# raspberry pi setup scripts

these are scripts i use to set up my raspberry pis :3

# quickstart
shell scripts in the base path are default scripts that can be used for any raspberry pi (i hope)
shell scripts in dedicated folders are for certain pis only! (e.g. zero2w is for the raspberry pi zero 2w)

# why i made this
i made this because i kept bricking my raspberry pis :sob: so i wanted an easy way to set up my raspberry pis without having to recall and reinstall everything.
